# Ai Assignment

Using AI to assist in creating the notebook offers several concrete benefits. One of the most significant is the ability to drastically reduce the time required to write code, especially for lengthy or repetitive tasks. This allows more time to focus on reviewing and verifying the code for accuracy, ensuring it meets the desired requirements. AI is also less prone to human errors, such as mistyping or forgetting to include necessary parameters, making the coding process more efficient and reliable. However, it’s essential to approach AI-generated code critically, as it isn’t always correct. This requires an active review process, which can further enhance the quality of the work by combining the speed of AI with human judgment.

There are dangers, however, in relying on AI without a proper understanding of data science. Using AI without grasping the material can result in significant errors or irrelevant results. For instance, submitting a report to a company based solely on AI-generated outputs could lead to inaccurate findings or even a report that doesn’t address the intended objectives. Additionally, I had to verify outputs like the color palette for graphs (palette=['green', 'red']) and adjust incorrect defaults such as kde=True in histograms or n_neighbors=5 in the k-NN classifier, which needed to be set to 3. This verification process highlights the importance of human oversight to ensure AI outputs align with expectations and requirements.
